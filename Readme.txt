Creating an AI-Driven Advertisement(NextGen Ads) Slogan Generator with Flask

In this blog post, we'll walk through the development of a web application that generates creative advertisement slogans based on product details and user emotions. This project leverages the power of natural language processing (NLP) models to understand user emotions from text and generate suitable ad slogans.

Application Overview

Our application uses Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, to handle HTTP requests and render HTML templates. It uses pre-trained NLP models to detect emotions in user reviews and generate advertisement slogans accordingly.

Here's a high-level overview of the application:

A user submits a product review and product details through a web form.
The application detects the emotion expressed in the review.
Based on the detected emotion and product details, it generates a creative advertisement slogan.
The generated slogan and description are displayed to the user.

Let's break down the code step by step.

Setting Up the Flask Application
First, we import the necessary modules and initialize the Flask app.

Configuring the Together API Client
We configure the Together API client with the appropriate API key. This client will be used to generate advertisement slogans.

Setting Up the NLP Model
We use a pre-trained emotion detection model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model is fine-tuned for emotion classification tasks.

Defining the Emotion Detection Function
The 'detect_emotion' function takes a piece of text as input and returns the detected emotion.

Defining the Route for the Home Page
The home page renders an HTML form where users can input their product review and product details.

Generating Advertisement Slogans
The 'create_ad_slogan' function constructs a prompt with the given product details and detected emotion. It then sends this prompt to the Together API to generate an advertisement slogan and description.

Extracting JSON Data
The 'extract_json' function extracts JSON data from the API response.

Handling Form Submissions
The '/generate' route handles form submissions. It detects the emotion from the user review, generates the advertisement slogan and description, and renders the results.

Running the Application
Finally, we run the Flask application in debug mode.

Conclusion:
In this blog post, we created a Flask web application that generates creative advertisement slogans based on user emotions and product details. We leveraged the power of pre-trained NLP models and the Together API to build an intelligent and interactive application. This project showcases the potential of combining web development with AI to create innovative solutions.
